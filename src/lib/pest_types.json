        "lead": "One of the largest orders of insects is the hymenopterod, which includes wasps, bees, and ants.",
        "body1": "Almost 130,000 species have been described, and many more are still to be discovered. The number of species in the Maltese Islands is still unknown because new species are constantly being discovered, but a very rough estimate from local literature shows that up until 1995, over 178 species—including 113 species of wasps, 46 species of bees, and roughly 52 species of ants—were already known there. Many of them are endemic species, such as the Maltese Slave Keeper Ant (Strongylognatus insularis), which is exclusive to Comino Island and the Maltese archipelago.",
        "body2": "Typically, females have a unique ovipositor for placing eggs inside their hosts or other difficult-to-reach locations. Often, the ovipositor is transformed into a stinger. Before reaching adulthood, the young go through a full metamorphosis, which includes a worm-like larval stage and an inactive pupal stage.",
        "body3": "Although while many species are thought to be household pests, very few have been shown to be such (by, for example, spreading illness, etc.), yet their persistence in numbers is typically seen as an annoyance to the establishment's owner."

        "lead": "The parasitic, evasive, and tiny bedbugs are all members of the Cimicidae family of insects.",
        "body1": "They only consume human and other warm-blooded animal blood as food (such as other mammals and birds). The term 'bed bug' refers to an insect that like to live in homes, particularly on beds or other public spaces where people may sleep. The presence of a host means that these insects may also be found on carpets and in other places. Although not completely nocturnal, bedbugs are most active at night and have the ability to feast on their victims undetected. There are thought to be between 75 and 108 different species of bedbugs. Humans are often only consumed by species in the absence of other prey.",
        "body2": "Although the exact number of species in Malta is currently unclear, it is assumed that the most global species reside there. Cimex lectularius is the sole species that has been observed here thus far. However lately populations have expanded and few instances have been documented from private residences, the latter is mostly found in hotels. Reddish-brown, flattened, oval, and wingless describe adult bedbugs. The minute hairs of bedbugs give them a banded look. These can be seen with the naked eye, contrary to popular belief. Adults reach lengths of 4-5 mm and widths of 1.5–3 mm. The length of a bedbug's life depends on both feeding and species.",
        "body3": "Insects that feed on blood are bedbugs. They often graze at their peak an hour or so before sunrise when out at night just before morning. Bedbugs have been seen eating at all times of the day and may try to feed at other times if given the chance. When they sense a heat wave, they may drop down from the ceiling after climbing up walls to approach their host. Warmth and the presence of carbon dioxide are factors that bedbugs use to draw their hosts. The beetle uses two hollow feeding tubes to puncture its host's skin.",
        "body4": "It uses one tube to inject its saliva, which includes anesthetics and anticoagulants to prevent blood clotting, and the other to take blood from its host. The beetle goes back to hiding after about five minutes of eating. The first sign of a bite is typically the need to scratch the bite site because the bites are typically not felt until minutes or hours after they occur as a dermatological reaction to the injected chemicals. Bedbugs only emerge at night because of their innate intolerance to sunshine."

        "body1": "While these insects have a terrible reputation around the world, many cockroaches reside in warm, tropical locations and feed on decaying wood and leaves. They aid in the breakdown of organic detritus while also adding nutrients to the soil through their feces. They also provide food for tiny reptiles and animals. Cockroaches, in other words, play a crucial role in many ecosystems.",
        "body2": "In the many places of the world, only one or two species are responsible for the majority of infestations. Regrettably, individuals own a large portion of the blame for this global occurrence. The majority of cockroach pests have spread over the world via hitchhiking on boats, aircraft, vehicles, and even moving boxes and shopping bags.",
        "body3": "Cockroaches may be found in a variety of habitats across the world. Cockroach pest species are adaptable to a wide range of habitats, but prefer the warm temperatures found within buildings. Female cockroaches are occasionally observed carrying egg cases on the end of their abdomen; the egg case of most cockroach species carries around 30 to 40 long, thin eggs packed like frankfurters in the case known as an ootheca. The eggs hatch as a result of the combined pressure of the hatchlings gulping air, resulting in dazzling white nymphs (young) that continue to inflate themselves with air, growing firmer and darker within four hours. Its fleeting white stage during hatching and subsequently while molting (losing their outer skin) has led to numerous reports of albino cockroach sightings.",
        "body4": "Locals think that the 'white roach' is a different super species that only lives underground and orders other cockroach species to perform their bidding. Getting them food and washing them is one example. This is clearly a myth. We also have a propensity to identify all cockroach nymphs and lesser species by referring to them as 'Kokroċ' while the huge ones and adulst with wings as 'Wirdiena'.",
        "body5": "The Maltese islands are home to seven different species. These are Cockrochs from the United States (Periplaneta americana) Wirdiena Ħamra, German Cockroach (Blattella germanica) Kokroċ tal-Faxx, the Oriental Cockroach (Blatta orientalis) Brown-banded Cockroach Wirdiena tad-Djar (Supella longipalpa) Kokroċ Isfar, the Egyptian Cockroach (Polyphaga aegyptiaca) Wirdiena The Field Cockroach, Sewda (Loboptera decipiens) Wood Cockroach with Wirdiena tal-Gelieqi (Ectobius kraussianus) Wirdiena tal-Buskett is a woman.",
        "body6": "The last two are never encountered in families since one is limited to a single location and the other is restricted to garigue environment. The Oriental, Brown-banded, and Egyptian roaches are rarely encountered since they like human disturbed regions yet are not found in them. The latter may be drawn to a dusty environment, such as an abandoned garage, although it is harmless, and females are quickly destroyed by giant woodlice, while males are fooled with moths. Additional species are being discovered nearby as well. On the other hand, American and German cockroaches may be quite devoted to our homes, particularly our kitchens, and should be handled as pests.",
        "body7": "The American cockroach prefers damp environments, although it may survive in arid locations if it has access to water. Members of this species enjoy mild temperatures ranging from 28 to 32 degrees Celsius and do not survive extreme cold. These cockroaches dwell in kitchens, basements, and sewers in residential areas and may venture outside during warm weather. During mating season, they have been observed flying. The latter is also a scavenger that feeds on decaying organic debris and a range of different foods to enhance its resilience. It is very fond of fermented foods. Females lay eggs that protrude from the apex of their abdomen for around two days. The egg cases are then often put on a surface in a concealed area.",
        "body8": "This species' female bears an egg capsule containing around 40 eggs. She drops the capsule before hatching, however live births are uncommon. It takes 3 to 4 months for eggs to develop into adults. Cockroaches may survive for up to a year. The female may lay up to eight egg cases in her lifetime, and under ideal conditions, she can have 300 to 400 offspring. Some cockroach species, on the other hand, can lay an exceptionally large number of eggs in a lifetime, but in other circumstances, the female only has to be fertilized once to be able to lay eggs for the rest of her life."

        "title": "Fleas",
        "lead": "The term 'flea'refers to an insect of the class Siphonaptera, which are wingless insects with mouthparts designed for piercing skin and sucking blood.",
        "body1": "Fleas are parasites that feed on the blood of animals (including humans) and birds. Based on the similarities of the larvae, it was formerly considered that fleas developed from flies (Diptera). It is now more evident that they are descended from the flightless snow scorpion-flies, family Boreidae. There are around 2000 species of fleas recognized worldwide, while the number of local species is unknown. Their legs are lengthy, with the hind pair well adapted for vertical jumps of up to 18 cm and horizontal jumps of up to 33 cm on average. This is about 200 times its own body length, making the flea one of the finest jumpers known to man (in proportion to body size), second only to the froghopper.",
        "body2": "Their structures are laterally compressed, allowing simple passage through the host's hairs or feathers (or in the case of humans, under clothing). The flea body is hard, polished, and covered with many hairs and small spines pointing backwards, which aid in its mobility on the host. The robust body can endure a lot of pressure, which is probably an adaptation to survive elimination efforts like mashing and scratching. Squeezing a flea between your fingers is usually inadequate to kill it. As a flea reaches adulthood, its primary purpose is to find blood since adult fleas only eat blood.",
        "body3": "Elderly fleas have about a week to locate food once they emerge, however they can go between two months and a year without eating. The distribution of a flea population is unequal, with 50% eggs, 35% larvae, 10% pupae, and 5% adults. Their entire life cycle can be completed in as little as two weeks, but can be extended to several months if conditions are favorable. Female fleas can lay 500 or more eggs during their lifetime. Rabbit Fleas (Spilopsyllus cuniculi) Bergud tal-Fniek show obvious adaptations. Fleas bite dogs, cats, mice, chickens, rabbits, squirrels, rats, ferrets, and humans, among other warm-blooded animals.",
        "body4": "Its most abundant species include Cat Flea (Ctenocephalides felis) Bergħud tal-Qtates. The domestic cat is the principal host of this species, but it is also the primary flea that infests dogs in much of the world. The cat flea can also complete its life cycle on rabbits, rats, ruminants, and humans, but these unusual hosts cannot support a cat flea population. The Dog Flea (Ctenocephalides canis) Bergud tal-Klieb looks and behaves similarly to the cat flea, however it is more widespread in Europe. The Human Flea (Pulex irritans) Bergud tal-Bniedem, on the other hand, is a worldwide flea species with, despite its common name, a diverse host range.",
        "body5": "Apart from the troubles that the species causes, fleas can also function as a vector for illness. The Black Death, which killed millions of people in Europe during the Middle Ages, was caused by a flea type that was abundant on Black Rats and served as a vector for the bacteria Yersinia pestis."

        "body1": "This vast group has over 120,000 species globally, although it is estimated that many more of the same number are yet to be described. In terms of both ecological and human (medical and economic) relevance, it is one of the most important insect orders. While the majority of species are helpful and important to their native ecosystems, just a dozen or so are related with human habitations, and only a few are well known as pests. It is still uncertain how many species exist in the Maltese Islands because new species are discovered on a regular basis, although a very approximate estimate based on local literature shows that around 218 species were already recognized locally in 1995. Others have since been documented. The Schembri's Spider Fly (Ogcodes schembrii) Dubbiena tal-Brimb ta' Schembri is one of these indigenous species.",
        "body2": "Flies have small, streamlined bodies that are ideally adapted for airborne locomotion. They have a movable head with eyes, with big compound eyes on the sides of the head and five little ocelli on the top. To decrease drag when flying, antennas come in a range of shapes and sizes. Flies only eat liquid food, and their mouthparts and digestive tracts have evolved to accommodate this diet. The majority of animals spit out saliva on solid meals to predigest them before sucking in the exterior semi-digested material. They also regurgitate partially digested food and transfer it back to the stomach.",
        "body3": "The most primitive flies appear to have piercing blade-like mandibles and fleshy palps, although they have evolved into a variety of adaptive shapes in various taxa. Examples include mosquitoes' fine stilleto-like sucking mouthparts and houseflies' meaty proboscis. Large diverticulae (outpouchings of a hollow or fluid-filled structure) in the stomach allow the insect to retain modest amounts of fluids after a meal. The female lays her eggs as close to the food supply as possible, and growth is often quick, allowing the larva to devour as much food as possible before transitioning into an adult.",
        "body4": "In extraordinary situations, the eggs hatch right away, while a few fly are ovoviviparous (bear live young), with the larva hatching within the mother. House, Blue, Green, and Meat flies, for example, can be quite devoted to our enterprises and should be handled as pests. Diptera, particularly mosquitoes (Culicidae), are important disease transmitters on a global scale, functioning as vectors for malaria, dengue, West Nile virus, yellow fever, encephalitis, and other infectious illnesses."

Because squirrels are notoriously difficult to get rid of after they've 'put their feet under the table,' as well as their proclivity to return, hiring professional squirrel removal is sometimes the best course of action. Our squirrel pest control London crew has extensive expertise dealing with pesky squirrels, notably the common grey squirrel.",
        "body2": "The grey squirrel, the most prevalent and difficult to remove, was imported to Britain from America in the late nineteenth century and now accounts for a substantial part of the small animal population found in forests, gardens, and parks throughout the UK.",
        "body3": "When it comes to fighting for resources, it is very competitive, which is why it pushed out the red squirrel to the point that the latter was classified an endangered species. Grey squirrels often stay in the wild or in gardens, but if they do come inside your home, they don't see why they should leave. This is when you need call in the experts.",
        "subtitle": "What do a squirrel infection's various symptoms mean?",
        "body4": "Like many other pests, squirrels enter homes for warmth, shelter, water, and food. As heat rises in buildings, squirrels find lofts and attics to be highly alluring places to live. The issue is that while they are there, they may nibble on your roof timbers, water pipes, and electrical cables in addition to constructing their nests. Infections including tularemia, typhus, ringworm, and salmonella are also carried by them, but they are often only spread by bites. Except when they feel threatened, grey squirrels are not known for biting. They can also bring mites, fleas, and ticks into your home, which can then settle on you and your pets as well as in the carpeting and furniture."
